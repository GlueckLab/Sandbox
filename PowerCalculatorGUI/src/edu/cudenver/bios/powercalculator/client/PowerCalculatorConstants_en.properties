matrixBetaDetails = The beta matrix represents the estimated regression coefficient for each indepdendent variable
matrixDesignEssenceDetails = The "essence" design matrix is a reference cell coded representation of the study design.  \
Columns represent the possible values of each categorical independent variable ("fixed predictors").  A single column may \
be designated as a baseline covariate ("random predictor"), which is a random variable measured at baseline following a \
distribution with mean &mu; and variance &sigma;<sub>2</sub> (assumed normally distributed).  \
The rows of the essence matrix represent <u>unique</u> combinations of categorical variables\
<p>Note that only a single \
random predictor is allowed, since no published literature describing statistical techniques for multiple random covariates \
was found at the time this calculator was written.  

matrixThetaNullDetails = Matrix of null hypotheses.  The cells in this matrix represent the expected mean difference for each \
between subject or within subject comparison when the null hypothesis is true.  In most cases, all entries are zero, representing \
no difference in groups under the null hypothesis.
matrixBetweenSubjectContrastDetails = Contrast matrix for mean differences between subjects.  
matrixWithinSubjectContrastDetails = Within Subject Contrast matrix.
matrixSigmaErrorDetails = The variance / covariance matrix for the "error" in the model. \
The linear model is expressed as Y = X&beta; + E, where E represents error in the prediction equation. 
matrixSigmaGDetails = Variance / Covariance of the Random Baseline Covariate (&Sigma;<sub>G</sub>)

templateOutcomesHeader = Dependent Variables / Outcomes
templateOutcomesDetails = Outcome, or dependent variables, are the measurements \
taken on your subjects during your study.  For example, if investigators are examining the effect \
of a certain medication on blood pressure, the outcome variables may include systolic blood pressure \
and diastolic blood pressure.<p>To enter your outcome variables, type the name of the variable in \
the 'Outcome' text box, and click add.  To remove a given variable, click the 'X' button next to the variable \
in the display table.
templatePredictorsHeader = Independent Variables / Predictors
templatePredictorsDetails = Predictors, or independent variables, are the variables which are \
manipulated or controlled during your study.  For example, if investigators are examining the effect \
of a certain medication on blood pressure, the predictors might include treatment group and gender \
status.  Note that the predictors entered in this box should all be "fixed" or "categorical".  That is, they should \
have a predifined set of possible values, such as treatment A, B, or C or gender male vs. female.<p> \
<p>To enter your outcome variables, type the name of the variable in \
the 'Outcome' text box, and click add.  To remove a given variable, click the 'X' button next to the variable \
in the display table.<p>\
The Glimmpse program also allows you to control for a single baseline covariate.  Covariates are \
continuous (i.e. values such as age, weight which do not have predefined categories) values which \
can be considered a random characteristic of the study subjects and cannot be prespecified in the study design. \
For example, in the blood pressure study, researchers may want to control for the effect of baseline \
systolic blood pressure. \
<p>To include a baseline covariate, check the box under the predictor table.  Baseline covariates are \
assumed to follow a normal distribution (bell curve).  Therefore,  you will need to enter an estimate \
for the average value and variablilty for your covariate.  For example, if you wish to control for systolic blood pressure \
your population may have an average of 135, and most people may vary from this by about 7 mmHg either way. \
These values are best estimated from prior research, or based on the clinical expertise of your research team.
templateHypothesesHeader = Comparisons / Hypotheses
templateHypothesesDetails = Hypotheses are the questions you seek to answer in your study.
templateMeanHeader = Estimated Average Values in Each Group

the average value you expect for your outcomes.
