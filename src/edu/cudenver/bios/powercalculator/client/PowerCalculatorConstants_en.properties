startPanelDescriptionText = Welcome to the power and sample size calculator from the \
Colorado School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics<p/> \
This calculator is designed to estimate power and sample size for linear \
models. <br/>Models may contain fixed/categorical predictors or a single baseline covariate (random predictor)
