		<h1>Welcome to Glimmpse, the general linear multivariate model power and sample size estimator</h1>
		<p>
		This tool is designed to aid researchers in selecting appropriate power and sample size for 
		studies using the general linear multivariate model for data analysis.  Common examples of this model
		include the one and two sample t-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, and regression.
		</p>
		<p>
		This project was developed at the University of Colorado, department of Biostatistics and Bioinformations.  The power calculations are based on
		the work of Keith Muller at the University of Florida.
